## Git History Cleanup

If you encounter errors related to large files when pushing to GitHub, it means the repository's history contains files that should have been ignored. To fix this, the Git history must be reset. This is a one-time operation. You will need to run a specific set of commands in your local terminal to create a new, clean history and force-push it to the remote repository.
