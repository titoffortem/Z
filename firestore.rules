/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a security model based on user ownership and explicit shared access.
 * It provides public read access for social content like user profiles and posts to support
 * discovery and content feeds, while strictly protecting private data like direct messages
 * within chats. The default posture is to deny access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * - /users/{userId}: User-owned profiles, readable by other signed-in users.
 * - /posts/{postId}: Publicly readable posts, with write access restricted to the original author.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Private chat conversations, accessible only to users listed in the participantIds array.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Messages within a chat, inheriting access controls from the parent chat.
 * - /posts/{postId}/likes/{likeId}: Publicly readable likes, with write access restricted to the user who created the like.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Public vs. Private**: A clear separation is maintained between public collections (/posts, /users)
 *   and private collections (/chats). This structural segregation simplifies rules and improves query performance.
 * - **No User Listing**: The top-level /users and /chats collections cannot be listed by clients to prevent
 *   data scraping and protect user privacy. Clients must query for specific documents they know the ID of or
 *   use queries secured by rules (e.g., querying chats they are a member of).
 * - **Ownership via UID**: Write operations are almost always gated by checking if the authenticated user's
 *   ID (request.auth.uid) matches an ownership field (e.g., userId) on the document.
 * - **Shared Access for Chats**: Access to chats and their subcollections is managed by a participantIds array on
 *   the parent /chats/{chatId} document. This avoids complex role management and provides a clear, auditable
 *   line of authorization.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * To ensure performant and simple security rules, this ruleset relies on denormalized data:
 * - /posts/{postId}: Contains a userId field to verify ownership without needing to look up other documents.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Contains a participantIds array. Rules on its /messages subcollection perform a get()
 *   on the parent chat document to verify the requesting user is a current participant. This is a secure and
 *   necessary read operation to protect the entire subcollection.
